Learning Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This is closely followed by a [Udemy Class](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview).
Datasets are obtained from [Here](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/)

[Bank Customer Classification using an Atrificial Neural Network(ANN)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/Neural-Networks/blob/master/Deep_Learning/Supervised%20Deep%20Learning/Artificial%20Neural%20Networks%20%28ANN%29/ANN/Notebook/ANN_Bank_Customer_Classification.ipynb): The "Vanilla" Neural Nets. They are the most baic type of Deep Learning algorithms. Designed to mimic the processes in the human brain, they create a facility for a machine to learn instead of being hard-coded what to do. Artificial Neural Networks are a type of Supervised Learning Algorithm.
